# Pindorama

Pindorama is a 2D Top-down horror game. It is exploring the theme of domination and destruction of culture and societies.
It's a game where you are a giant otter, exploring a house full of Maned wolves. All the maned wolves have been anthropomorphized, and you have not.
It was inspired by the colonization process of South America, by Portugal and Spain. 

The whole game is dichromatic, with only raycasted parts around the player being visible. You can also see visual inndicators of the closest maned wolves
walking around and producing step noises. You cannot kill the enemies, but you can run from them.

In this game, you do not exactly die, you only ever get punished. Getting punished means you get whiped, causing the player to bleed, and get
thrown in a cell, which you have to escape first to then continue playthrough. You can get healed by visiting other giant otters, who are in another room in the house
other than the prision you have been thrown into.
